## HealthBuddy
HealthBuddy is a web based platform built on Django which will make the entire process of The Health Centre at IIT Kanpur paper-less. It will have separate endpoints for various departments like reception, doctor, user, pharmacy etc. This will digitize health center's record keeping process and will make the whole process smooth and convenient for both patients and staff. User end wil also have features like reminders for future doctor visits, timings of doctors, setting up appointments etc. This will also help doctors as the entire medical history their patient will be just a few clicks away.
